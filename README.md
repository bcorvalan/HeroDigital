## Comments

Normally, Next.js tends to use npm start for productive environments, where it is necessary to run npm run build beforehand. In this case the requirements asked only to run npm install and npm start to be able to run, which is why I chose to change npm start to run the development environment. In a productive environment it is recommended to configure the package.json similar to https://nextjs.org/docs#manual-setup
